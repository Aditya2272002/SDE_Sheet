10th July 2022 STARTING
1. BT implementation
2. Traversal 
   DFS :- Inorder, Preorder, Postorder
   BFS :- Levelorder
3. Levelorder on Nry tree or we want elements of each level only in Queue
4. Questions:-
   Reverse Levelorder  
   Height of BT (Maximum depth of BT) -> Use recursion ðŸ˜Ž
   Minimum depth of BT -> Use recursion ðŸ˜Ž
   Invert a BT or Mirror of BT
   Diameter of BT ðŸ”–IMPO
   Left,Right view of Tree -> LevelOrder Q.3
   Bottom,Top view of tree -> Consider a number Line (map + Queue)
   ZigZag Traversal -> Two stack stackOdd and stackEven
   Types of BT [MEDIUM]  
   Diagonal Traversal Tree
